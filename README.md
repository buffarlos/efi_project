# Teensy EFI Project

The goal of this project is to implement a fuel injection system based on the Teensy 4.0 microcontroller. The Teensy code will include provisions for metering mass air flow and calculating the appropriate fuel injection load.

## Installation

There will eventually be C++ code in the repository that can be flashed onto Teensy 4.0 through Arduino IDE.
